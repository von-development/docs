   Fully managed model for deployment running in LangChain's cloud. A simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers. Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

   **(Enterprise)** Manage the data plane in your own cloud, while LangChain manages the control plane. Build a Docker image using the LangGraph CLI and deploy your LangGraph Server from the control plane UI.

    **(Enterprise)** Run all components entirely within your own cloud environment. Deploy the full LangSmith platform or standalone instances of a LangGraph Server without the control plane UI.
